messagebus is a library crafted for sending messages on a bus, providing foundational classes
for event-driven development and Domain-Driven Design.

It includes a comprehensive registration system that utilizes decorators and handlers
to dispatch events effectively.

messagebus is used for internal messaging inside a python program, but also,
with external services that can consume messages throw an event stream,
where message can be published to a given transport.

messagebus supports both asynchronous operations using async/await and a synchronous API.

.. note::
    The synchronous API is generated by unasync from the asynchronous api.
