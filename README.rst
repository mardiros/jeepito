messagebus is a library to send message in a bus in order to get base classes
for event driven development and :term:`Domain Driven Design`.

messagebus is used for internal messaging inside a python program, but also,
with external services that can consume messages throw an event stream,
where message can be published to a given transport.

messagebus support both asynchronous using async/await and synchronous API.

.. note::
    The synchrounous API is generated by unasync from the asynchronous api.
